# Elfos-boot

This tools allows booting an Elf/OS kernel other than the default installed one. This allows for easy testing of new kernels with a backout that is nothing more than a reboot.

The tool takes a single command-line argument which is the pathname of the kernel to boot. Or if called with no argument, it boots the default kernel just like "reboot" does.
